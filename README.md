A simple SPA with a table displaying absences

## Features

**Light / Dark mode**\
Dark mode on operating systems is becoming increasingly popular due to its benefits, including reduced eye strain, improved visibility, better sleep, and energy efficiency. Our application is designed with both light and dark mode styling to align with these preferences.
